Bessey, several times I began to realize how simple of a concept it really was. If you have 5 pigeons and only 4 pigeon nests, then at least one pigeon nest will contain 2 pigeons. When I first read the article, I thought that the Pigeonhole Principle was related to probability. In probability, you divide a part of a population by the whole population. For example, the chances of you rolling a 6 on a dice is 1 out of 6 chances or 1/6 = 0.1667 = 16.7% chance. This is not the same as the Pigeonhole Principle. In the Pigeonhole Principle, you take the whole population and divide it by the number of possible \"containers.\" As you can see, the more that I read and understood the Pigeonhole Principle, the more clear it became to me that it is not the same thing as porbability<font color=\"red\">(probability)</font>. Instead, the Pigeonhole Principle is based on facts."

She thought that the Pigeonhole Effect made a conclusion about ALL pigeonholes. In other words, when I told her that at least two people living in Eastern Idaho had the same number of hairs on their head, she thought that all \"pigeonholes\" or numbers of hairs on a person's head had to be accounted for before someone could have the same number of hairs on their head as someone else. By this point, I was a little confused with what she was saying, so we decided to read the article by Brother Kent A. Bessey together. It was pretty cool because the more we read, the more it made sense to her, and the more excited she got! In the four years that I have known her, I have never seen her get as excited about math as I saw her during our discussion. When I finally showed her the problem I had worked with my group on in the ponder and prove for this week, she was able to understand pretty much all of it."
